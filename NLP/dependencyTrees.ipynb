Some examples are Named entity extraction, coreference resolution, and machine translation."

This organization is often depicted by the word-to-word grammar relationships which are also known as dependencies. Dependency is the notion that syntactic units (words) are connected to each other by directed links which describe the relationship possessed by the connected words."
