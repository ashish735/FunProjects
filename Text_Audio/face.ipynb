    "\n",
    "A face recognition system comprises of two step process i.e. face detection (bounded face) in image followed by face identification (person identification) on the detected bounded face. The following two techniques are used for respective mentioned tasks in face recognition system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Task Cascaded Convolution Networks (MTCNN, 2015): It detects all the faces in an image and put a bounding box to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet CNN Model (FaceNet, 2015) : It generates embedding (512 dimensional feature vector in the pre-trained model used here) of the detected bounded face which is further matched against embeddings of the training faces of people in the database. This model is used for person identification in the detected face.\n"

    "Before moving ahead, we will understand the difference between verification and identification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Face verification\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers the problem of person verification i.e. whether the person is present in the detected face. For example, we may need to verify a person by matching the detected face with his/her stored historical facial images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification is implemented using a threshold score (an empirical value) such that if the score is below threshold then it is considered positive and vice versa. A score is calculated as euclidean distance between vector embeddings of two faces in question. A low score means the detected face is close to the stored historical face of person (and hence verified). Likewise, a high score means both the faces are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet achieved accuracy of 98.87% ± 0.15 and 99.63% ±0.09 with two different settings on the LFW face verification task. The selected optimal threshold as 1.24. Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is the de-facto academic test-set for face verification which contains more than 13,000 labelled facial images of 1680 people collected from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Face Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers the problem of person identification on detected face in the image. For example, we may need to identify a person in the detected face against a database of 1000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification can be implemented by training a simple multi-class classifier like K-NN or SVM over the embedding of faces generated by FaceNet.  As this post progresses, we will see how we can train a face classifier on our own data-set of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably, you might be interested in reading this paper thoroughly to check identification and verification accuracy on 1 million faces (MegaFace benchmark). For both the tasks above, a face detector has to run at first place in order to detect bounded faces in image."
